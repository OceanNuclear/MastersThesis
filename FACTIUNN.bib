Neutronics experiments are carried out at the Joint European Torus (JET) in preparation for the forthcoming high performance Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) campaign. Among others, activation foil measurements are performed in order to evaluate neutron streaming in various positions within the torus hall far from the plasma source. In the present study, the neutron fluence measurements performed using activation foils during the JET Deuterium-Deuterium (D-D) campaign are discussed. The activation foil results in terms of reaction rates are compared against Monte Carlo simulations and a satisfactory agreement is observed. Moreover, the pre-analysis of the experiments to be performed in the forthcoming JET Tritium-Tritium (T-T) and Deuterium-Tritium (D-T) campaigns is presented. The results of the study provide important data and support the preparation of the experimental activities in view of the planned JET D-T operation, allowing the exploitation of the unique 14 MeV neutron yields anticipated. Furthermore, they contribute to the validation of the tools employed in nuclear analyses, which are fundamental for the design and safety of ITER and future fusion power plants.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of the nuclear environment within a test tritium breeding-blanket module of a fusion reactor is crucial to determine tritium production rates which are relevant to self-sufficiency of tritium fuel supply, tritium accountancy and also to the evaluation of localised power levels produced in blankets. This requires evaluation of the time-dependent spectral neutron flux within the test tritium breeding-blanket module under harsh radiation and temperature environments. The application of an activation foil-based spectrometer system to determine neutron flux density using a pneumatic transfer system in ITER has been studied, deployed and tested on the Joint European Torus (JET) machine in a recent deuterium - deuterium campaign for a selection of high purity activation foils. Deployment of the spectrometer system has provided important functional and practical testing of the detector measurement system, associated hardware and post processing techniques for the analysis of large data sets produced through the use of list mode data collection. The testing is invaluable for the optimisation of systems for future planned testing in tritium - tritium and deuterium - tritium conditions. Analysis of the time and energy spectra collected to date and the status of the development of methods for post-processing are presented in this paper.},

In the preparation for the Deuterium-Tritium campaign, JET will operate with a tritium plasma. The T + T reaction consists of two notable channels: (1) T + T → 4He + 2n, (2) T + T → 5He + n → 4He + 2n. The reaction channel (1) is the reaction with the highest branching ratio and a continuum of neutron energies being produced. Reaction channel (2) produces a spectrum with a peak at 8.8 MeV. A particular problem is the ratio between the individual TT reaction channels, which is highly dependent on the energy of the reacting tritium ions. There are very few measurements on the TT spectrum and the study at JET would be interesting.The work is focused on the determination of the spectral characteristics in the TT plasma discharges, especially on the presence of the 8.8 MeV peak, a consequence of channel (2) of the TT reaction. The possibility to use an optimized set of activation materials in order to target the measurement of the 8.8 MeV peak is studied. The lower limit of detection for the channel (2) ratio within the TT reaction is estimated and the influence of DT source neutrons, which are a consequence of deuterium traces in the plasma, is investigated.},

AbstractActivation measurements can be used for neutron spectrum determination in irradiation facilities. It is very important that self-shielding is taken correctly into account. Activation measurements of monitor materials were performed at the CEA EOLE facility. Self-shielding factors for the monitor materials were calculated at the Commissariat a l’Energie Atomique with the TRIPOLI 4.6 code using a detailed whole-core model, and at the Jožef Stefan Institute with the MCNP code using a simplified model. The results were compared to assess the relative merits and the achievable accuracy of the calculations. In the end, the results were used to determine the neutron spectrum of the studied location in the EOLE irradiation facility.},

abstract = {A spectrum unfolding technique GAMCD (Genetic Algorithm and Monte Carlo based spectrum Deconvolution) has been developed using the genetic algorithm methodology within the framework of Monte Carlo simulations. Each Monte Carlo history starts with initial solution vectors (population) as randomly generated points in the hyper dimensional solution space that are related to the measured data by the response matrix of the detection system. The transition of the solution points in the solution space from one generation to another are governed by the genetic algorithm methodology using the techniques of cross-over (mating) and mutation in a probabilistic manner adding new solution points to the population. The population size is kept constant by discarding solutions having lesser fitness values (larger differences between measured and calculated results). Solutions having the highest fitness value at the end of each Monte Carlo history are averaged over all histories to obtain the final spectral solution. The present method shows promising results in neutron spectrum unfolding for both under-determined and over-determined problems with simulated test data as well as measured data when compared with some existing unfolding codes. An attractive advantage of the present method is the independence of the final spectra from the initial guess spectra.},

abstract = {A neutron activation system (NAS) is a highly useful and reliable tool for neutron flux and energy-spectrum measurements in fusion devices. We are evaluating a fast and efficient methodology for processing of fusion NAS data. Starting with the gamma spectra of irradiated activation materials, the method ultimately produces unfolded spectrum of the incident neutrons and uncertainty estimates. Here, we test the method using data from dedicated experiments at the Joint European Torus (JET) tokamak in Culham and the Nuclear Physics Institute (NPI) in Řež. These measurements utilize few, from three to five reaction channels as input to the unfolding process. Two spectral adjustment code-packages have been adapted for this purpose: MAXED from UMG 3.3 and STAYSL-PNNL. While the former is frequently applied, the latter is a new addition to the case of fusion device NAS. We present the post-analyses of NAS data, spectral adjustments and some discussion on the experiences with these tools, required developments and our planned future studies.},

abstract = {Neutron fluence and neutron ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), are important physical quantities for neutron radiation protection and monitoring. They can be deduced from neutron spectrum, which is usually measured by multisphere system with proper unfolding methods. Novel unfolding methods on the basis of artificial intelligence, mainly artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been researched and developed. However, without normalization on network inputs, ANNs can not be applied to accommodate demands of various neutron field measurements for neutron spectrum unfolding in practice, because the neutron spectra for training the ANNs are mostly extracted from IAEA (2001), the integrals of which over neutron energy are unit fluences. Moreover, derived from an unfolded normalized spectrum, the true values of neutron fluence and H*(10) are never to know. In this work, three normalization methods—zero-mean normalization method, min-max normalization method, and maximum-divided normalization method were used to process with the inputs of generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs), and a new method was proposed for neutron fluence and H*(10) estimations derived from unfolded neutron spectrum based on GRNNs for the first time. Sixty-three neutron spectra were unfolded based on GRNNs with use of three normalization methods, and the corresponding neutron fluences and H*(10) were obtained and compared. From the testing results, the GRNNs with the maximum-divided method is most effective to unfold neutron spectrum and to evaluate neutron fluence and H*(10). The feasibility of the method was further studied through experiments by using Bonner sphere spectrometer in well characterized 241Am–Be neutron field.},

abstract = {Neutron energy spectrum unfolding has been the subject of research for several years. The Bayesian theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and iterative methods are some of the methods that have been used for neutron spectrum unfolding. In this study, the radial basis function (RBF), multilayer perceptron, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used for the unfolding of neutron spectrum, and a comparison was made between the networks’ results. Both neural network architectures were trained and tested using the same data set for neutron spectrum unfolding from the response of LiI detectors with Eu impurity. Advantages of each ANN method in the unfolding of neutron energy spectrum were investigated, and the performance of the networks was compared. The results obtained showed that RBF neural network can be applied as an effective method for unfolding neutron spectrum, especially when the main target is the neutron dosimetry. •MLP and RBF were used for neutron spectrum unfolding using LiI detectors responses.•Performance of gradient descent is insufficient because of multiple local minima.•Levenberg-Marquardt training method for MLP network showed acceptable results.•RBF neural networks can be more effective for retrieving the neutron spectrum.•RBF network has better estimation of continuous spectrum in response to LiI detectors.},

abstract = {The Bonner Spheres Spectrometer consists of a thermal neutron sensor placed at the center of a number of moderating polyethylene spheres of different diameters. From the measured readings, information can be derived about the spectrum of the neutron field where measurements were made. Disadvantages of the Bonner system are the weight associated with each sphere and the need to sequentially irradiate the spheres, requiring long exposure periods. Provided a well-established response matrix and adequate irradiation conditions, the most delicate part of neutron spectrometry, is the unfolding process. The derivation of the spectral information is not simple because the unknown is not given directly as a result of the measurements. The drawbacks associated with traditional unfolding procedures have motivated the need of complementary approaches. Novel methods based on Artificial Intelligence, mainly Artificial Neural Networks, have been widely investigated. In this work, a neutron spectrum unfolding code based on neural nets technology is presented. This code is called Neutron Spectrometry and Dosimetry with Artificial Neural networks unfolding code that was designed in a graphical interface. The core of the code is an embedded neural network architecture previously optimized using the robust design of artificial neural networks methodology. The main features of the code are: easy to use, friendly and intuitive to the user. This code was designed for a Bonner Sphere System based on a 6LiI(Eu) neutron detector and a response matrix expressed in 60 energy bins taken from an International Atomic Energy Agency compilation. The main feature of the code is that as entrance data, for unfolding the neutron spectrum, only seven rate counts measured with seven Bonner spheres are required; simultaneously the code calculates 15 dosimetric quantities as well as the total flux for radiation protection purposes. This code generates a full report with all information of the unfolding in the HTML format. NSDann unfolding code is freely available, upon request to the authors. •An optimized artificial neural network was designed using robust design of neural nets.•Neural network was trained to solve neutron spectrometry and dosimetry problems.•Knowledge stored at synaptic weights after training neural net was extracted.•Using knowledge extracted, a neutron spectrum unfolding code was designed.•Neutron spectrum of a 241AmBe neutron source was unfolded using the code based on neural nets technology.},

abstract = {Many methods have been proposed and developed in research into neutron spectrum unfolding. In this work, three artificial intelligence optimization methods—genetic algorithms, radial basis function neural networks and generalized regression neural networks—were developed on the basis of former research to retrieve the neutron spectrum. Sixty-three neutron spectra were unfolded on the basis of the same response functions with the three methods, and three indexes—the mean squared error, the spectral quality and the sphere reading quality—were applied with the aim to compare the generalized unfolding performance. The results obtained with the three methods show that the unfolded neutron spectra are mostly acceptable using three methods without the initial guess spectra and that the generalized regression neural network method is the fastest and most accurate method with the most powerful generalization ability. •Three artificial intelligence methods are described and optimized.•Sixty-three spectra are unfolded with use of three artificial intelligence optimization methods.•The three optimization methods can effectively unfold neutron spectra.•The generalized regression neural network method is the fastest and most accurate among the three methods.},

abstract = {The most delicate part of neutron spectrometry, is the unfolding process. The derivation of the spectral information is not simple because the unknown is not given directly as a result of the measurements. Novel methods based on Artificial Neural Networks have been widely investigated. In prior works, back propagation neural networks (BPNN) have been used to solve the neutron spectrometry problem, however, some drawbacks still exist using this kind of neural nets, i.e. the optimum selection of the network topology and the long training time. Compared to BPNN, it's usually much faster to train a generalized regression neural network (GRNN). That's mainly because spread constant is the only parameter used in GRNN. Another feature is that the network will converge to a global minimum, provided that the optimal values of spread has been determined and that the dataset adequately represents the problem space. In addition, GRNN are often more accurate than BPNN in the prediction. These characteristics make GRNNs to be of great interest in the neutron spectrometry domain. This work presents a computational tool based on GRNN capable to solve the neutron spectrometry problem. This computational code, automates the pre-processing, training and testing stages using a k-fold cross validation of 3 folds, the statistical analysis and the post-processing of the information, using 7 Bonner spheres rate counts as only entrance data.

@article{ANN-ModifiedLeastSquare,
issn = {0969-806X},
abstract = {In the present paper, neutron spectrum is reconstructed using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Modified Least Square (MLSQR) methods. The detector's response (pulse height distribution) as a required data for unfolding of energy spectrum is calculated using the developed MCNPX-ESUT computational code (MCNPX-Energy engineering of Sharif University of Technology). Unlike the usual methods that apply inversion procedures to unfold the energy spectrum from the Fredholm integral equation, the MLSQR method uses the direct procedure. Since liquid organic scintillators like NE-213 are well suited and routinely used for spectrometry of neutron sources, the neutron pulse height distribution is simulated/measured in the NE-213 detector. The response matrix is calculated using the MCNPX-ESUT computational code through the simulation of NE-213 detector's response to monoenergetic neutron sources. For known neutron pulse height distribution, the energy spectrum of the neutron source is unfolded using the MLSQR method. In the developed multilayer perception neural network for reconstruction of the energy spectrum of the neutron source, there is no need for formation of the response matrix. The multilayer perception neural network is developed based on logsig, tansig and purelin transfer functions. The developed artificial neural network consists of two hidden layers of type hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function and a linear transfer function in the output layer. The motivation of applying the ANN method may be explained by the fact that no matrix inversion is needed for energy spectrum unfolding. The simulated neutron pulse height distributions in each light bin due to randomly generated neutron spectrum are considered as the input data of ANN. Also, the randomly generated energy spectra are considered as the output data of the ANN. Energy spectrum of the neutron source is identified with high accuracy using both MLSQR and ANN methods. The results obtained from MLSQR and ANN methods for 252Cf and 241Am-9Be source are validated against the ISO spectrum. The unfolded neutron energy spectra from both MLSQR and ANN methods show a good agreement with the actual spectrum of 252Cf and 241Am-9Be source. •Pulse height distributions of 252Cf and 241Am-9Be were simulated using MCNPX-ESUT.•The neutron pulse height distributions of 252Cf and 241Am-9Be were measured.•The neutron energy spectrum was unfolded using the MLSQR.•Multilayer perception neural network for energy spectrum unfolding was developed.•The MLSQR gives more accurate results in comparison to ANN method.},

abstract = {A determination of fast ion population parameters such as intensity and kinetic temperature is important for fusion reactors. This becomes more challenging with finer time resolution of the measurements, since the limited data in each time slice cause increasing statistical variations in the data. This paper describes a framework using Bayesian-regularized neural networks (NNs) designed for such a task. The method is applied to the TOFOR 2.5 MeV fusion neutron spectrometer at JET. NN training data are generated by random sampling of variables in neutron spectroscopy models. Ranges and probability distributions of the parameters are chosen to match the experimental data. Results have shown good performance both on synthetic and experimental data. The latter was assessed by statistical considerations and by examining the robustness and time consistency of the results. The regularization of the training algorithm allowed for higher time resolutions than simple forward methods. The fast execution time makes this approach suitable for real-time analysis with a time resolution limit in the microsecond time scale.},

abstract = {In 2011-2012, an experimental campaign with a significant yield of fusion neutrons was carried out on the JET tokamak. During this campaign the facility was equipped with two diamond detectors based on natural and artificial CVD diamond. These detectors were designed and manufactured in State Research Center of Russian Federation TRINITI. The detectors measure the flux of fast neutrons with energies above 0.2 MeV. They have been installed in the torus hall and the distance from the center of plasma was about 3 m. For some of the JET pulses in this experiment, the neutron flux density corresponded to the operational conditions in collimator channels of ITER Vertical Neutron Camera. The main objective of diamond monitors was the measurement of total fast neutron flux at the detector location and the estimation of the JET total neutron yield. The detectors operate as threshold counters. Additionally a spectrometric measurement channel has been configured that allowed us to distinguish various energy components of the neutron spectrum. In this paper we describe the neutron signal measuring and calibration procedure of the diamond detector. Fluxes of DD and DT neutrons at the detector location were measured. It is shown that the signals of total neutron yield measured by the diamond detector correlate with signals measured by the main JET neutron diagnostic based on fission chambers with high accuracy. This experiment can be considered as a successful test of diamond detectors in ITER-like conditions.},

@article{DiamondDetector2,
issn = {0920-3796},
abstract = {Artificial diamond neutron detectors recently proved to be promising devices to measure the neutron production on large experimental fusion machines. Diamond detectors are very promising detectors to be used in fusion environment due to their radiation hardness, low sensitivity to gamma rays, fast response and high energy resolution. High quality “electronic grade” diamond films are produced through microwave chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique. Two CVD diamond detectors have been installed and operated at joint European torus (JET), Culham Science Centre, UK. One of these detectors was a polycrystalline CVD diamond film; about 12 mm 2 area and 30 μm thickness while the second was a monocrystalline film of about 5 mm 2 area and 20 μm thick. Both diamonds were covered with 2 μm of lithium fluoride (LiF) 95% enriched in 6Li. The LiF layer works as a neutron-to-charged particle converter so these detectors can measure thermalized neutrons. Their output signals were compared to JET total neutron yield monitors (KN1 diagnostic) realized with a set of uranium fission chambers. Despite their small active volumes the diamond detectors were able to measure total neutron yields with good reliability and stability during the recent JET experimental campaign of 2006.},

We calculated the neutron response matrix of the instrument combining MCNPX simulations, a generic proton light output function measured with another detector and the fit of data from ohmic pulses. For the analysis, we selected a set of pulses with neutral beam injection heating (NBI) only and we applied a forward fitting procedure of modeled spectral components to extract the fraction of thermal neutron emission. The results showed the same trend of the ones obtained with the dedicated spectrometer TOFOR, even though the values from the NE213 analysis were systematically higher. This discrepancy is probably due to the different lines of sight of the two spectrometers (tangential for the NE213, vertical for TOFOR). The uncertainties on the thermal fraction estimates were from 4 to 7 times higher than the ones from the TOFOR analysis.},

abstract = {The analysis of (e,e′n) experiments at the Darmstadt superconducting electron linear accelerator S-DALINAC required the calculation of neutron response functions for the NE213 liquid scintillation detectors used. In an open geometry, these response functions can be obtained using the Monte Carlo codes NRESP7 and NEFF7. However, for more complex geometries, an extended version of the Monte Carlo code MCNP exists. This extended version of the MCNP code was improved upon by adding individual light-output functions for charged particles. In addition, more than one volume can be defined as a scintillator, thus allowing the simultaneous calculation of the response for multiple detector setups. With the implementation of 12 C(n,n′3α) reactions, all relevant reactions for neutron energies E n <20 MeV are now taken into consideration. The results of these calculations were compared to experimental data using monoenergetic neutrons in an open geometry and a 252 Cf neutron source in the complex Darmstadt setup, where in both cases excellent agreement was found.},

While several neutron spectrometers were operational during this campaign, the present paper is concerned solely with one: the tandem annular-radiator proton-recoil spectrometer (or proton recoil telescope, for brevity). During neutral beam heating with combined d- and t-beams, analysis of the spectra can define the core fuel composition (D:T) ratio. The spectra are sensitive to the population balance of the fast ions streaming in directions parallel and opposite to that of the injected beams. During ICRF heating of minority deuterium in bulk tritium plasmas, the spectra provide measurements of the effective temperature of the fast-deuteron energy tail and of its relative strength, which vary with the deuterium concentration. This information contributes to the overall understanding of the fusion performance of the various operating scenarios.},

abstract = {In this paper, the scattered and direct neutron fluxes in the line of sight (LOS) of the TOFOR neutron spectrometer at JET are simulated and the simulations compared with measurement results. The Monte Carlo code MCNPX is used in the simulations, with a vessel material composition obtained from the JET drawing office and neutron emission profiles calculated from TRANSP simulations of beam ion density profiles. The MCNPX simulations show that the material composition of the scattering wall has a large effect on the shape of the scattered neutron spectrum. Neutron source profile shapes as well as radial and vertical source displacements in the TOFOR LOS are shown to only marginally affect the scatter, while having a larger impact on the direct neutron flux. A matrix of simulated scatter spectra for mono-energetic source neutrons is created which is folded with an approximation of the source spectrum for each JET pulse studied to obtain a scatter component for use in the data analysis. The scatter components thus obtained are shown to describe the measured data. It is also demonstrated that the scattered flux is approximately constant relative to the total neutron yield as measured with the JET fission chambers, while there is a larger spread in the direct flux, consistent with simulations. The simulated effect on the integrated scattered/direct ratio of an increase with movements outward along the radial direction and a drop at higher values of the vertical plasma position is also reproduced in the measurements. Finally, the quantitative agreement found in scatter/direct ratios between simulations (0.185±0.005) and measurements (0.187±0.050) serves as a solid benchmark of the MCNPX model used.},

Among the technological activities performed at JET in support of the scientific objectives of both JET and ITER, a significant effort is devoted to the investigation of the erosion, transport and deposition of wall materials, and of their fuel retention properties. With the analysis of wall tiles retrieved in the 2010 shutdown, the full characterization of the previous JET carbon wall is obtained. In order to confirm the expectations on properties of the new ITER-Like Wall (ILW) installed in 2011, a large number of marker tiles and profiled tiles have been prepared and installed both in the main wall and in the divertor. These will be retrieved from the vessel during a short shutdown at the end of 2012 and analyzed. The major changes introduced by the new ILW materials in JET required also a new nuclear characterization of the machine. Neutronics measurements have been performed to obtain the neutron/γ-ray field changes inside and outside the JET machine. The experimental data are also used to validate neutronics codes used in ITER design. A new calibration of neutron detectors, scheduled in the 2012 shutdown and adopting the same procedure as in ITER, has been prepared based on extensive neutronics calculations.},

An NE-213 scintillation spectrometer, well described by response matrices for both neutrons and photons, is used as proton-recoil and Compton spectrometer. The experiments described here in more detail address the background problematic of two applications, an iron benchmark experiment with an ns-pulsed neutron source and a deep penetration mock-up experiment for the investigation of the ITER in-board shield system. The measured spectral neutron and photon fluences are compared with spectra calculated with the MCNP code on the basis of FENDL-1 data.

issn = {0029-5493},
abstract = {Highlights► JET neutron calibrations – methods and status. ► New calibrations – methods, deployments and contingency arrangements. ► Neutronics calculations in support – models and examples. The power output of fusion experiments and fusion reactor-like devices is measured in terms of the neutron emission rates which relate directly to the fusion yield rate. Determination of such parameters requires a set of absolutely calibrated neutron detectors. At JET, the Fission Chamber neutron detectors were originally calibrated some 20 years ago by performing a set of in-situ calibrations using neutron sources and the absolute calibration has been maintained since then by cross calibrations against Activation System measurements. After this elapsed time and a succession of changes to the internal and external JET structures, the JET neutron yield calibration needs re-measurement. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the arrangements being developed to allow a new calibration to be made.A new, more detailed, calibration is being provided by means of an engineering programme of development of the robotic tools which will allow safe and accurate deployment of a strong 252Cf source for the measurements. It is led by a scientific programme which seeks to better understand the limitations of the calibration, to optimise the measurements and other provisions, to provide corrections for perturbing factors and to ensure personnel safety and safe working conditions. Much of this work is based on an extensive programme of Monte-Carlo calculations. These include the updating of previous JET models to provide continuity of comparison with previous understanding, the provision of fast models for side effect estimation and the development of a new more detailed JET model which will allow comparisons with the older more homogeneous model while coping with the demands of the new calibration.},

abstract = {The absolute measurement of neutron emission rate from the whole plasma is a very important diagnostics as a fusion power monitor in fusion experimental devices with D‐T or D‐T operations. Here measurement techniques of time‐resolved and time‐integrated absolute neutron emission on the present tokamaks and ITER are reviewed. In the present tokamaks, fission chamber installed outside the vacuum vessel are very popular in the absolute neutron emission rate measurement. As well as conventional neutron monitors installed outside the vacuum vessel, in‐vessel neutron monitors using micro fission chamber are proposed for the absolute neutron emission rate measurement in ITER. The neutron activation system provides time‐integrated measurements of the total neutron yield with high accuracy by using well known neutron reaction cross sections, which is useful to maintain a robust measure of fusion energy production with stability and wide dynamic range. The calibration of the relation between the neutron emission rate in the whole plasma and the output of neutron monitor is the most important issue in the absolute neutron emission rate measurements. The calibration of the neutron detectors has been performed by moving a neutron source such as a 252 Cf neutron or a small accelerator‐based neutron generator. For the calibration in ITER, the neutron generator with neutron emission rate of 10 11   s −1 or stronger is required to obtain high accuracy.},
